# builder-jade

Jade plugin for [component-builder2](https://github.com/component/builder2.js).

- Caches compilations
- Either include the runtime as a dependency or a global
- Compiles the debugging version in development environment

## Example

```js
var build = require('component-builder2');
var jade = require('builder-jade');

build.scripts(nodes)
  .use('scripts', build.plugins.js())
  .use('templates', build.plugins.string())
  .use('templates', jade())
  .use('jade', jade());

build.pipe(process.stdout);
```

You could put your jade files in `.templates` or create your own field like `.jade`.

Without the global runtime, you have to define the `visionmedia/jade` dependency in every component that uses jade templates. This is quite annoying:

```json
{
  "name": "widget",
  "dependencies": {
    "visionmedia/jade": "*"
  },
  "templates": [
    "index.jade"
  ]
}
```

If you want to avoid this as, use the global runtime.

## Global Runtime

You may use the global runtime by prepending `jade.runtime` to your build and using the `.runtime` option:

```js
build.scripts(nodes)
  .use('templates', jade({
    runtime: true
  }))
  .toStr(function (err, string) {
    if (err) throw err;
    string = jade.runtime + string;
    fs.writeFileSync('build.js', string);
  })
```

This will create a global `jade` variable. However, the benefits are:

- Smaller `.js` build
- No more defining `visionmedia/jade` as a dependency in every component

However, you now essentially have to manage this dependency yourself.
